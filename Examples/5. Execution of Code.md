# Execution of Code
Java has a built-in threading and concurrency model that allows for parallel and concurrent execution of code. Understanding the threading and concurrency model in Java is essential for writing efficient and effective code that takes full advantage of multi-core processors.

## Thread Class
Java's Thread class is the foundation of the Java threading model. The Thread class provides methods for creating and manipulating threads, such as start() and join(). To create a new thread, you can create a new class that extends the Thread class and override the run() method, which is the entry point for the new thread.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running...");
    }
}

MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
myThread.start();
```

## Executor Class
The Executor class provides a more convenient way to create and manage threads. The Executor interface defines a single method execute(Runnable command), which accepts a Runnable object and runs it in a separate thread. The Executor interface is implemented by the ExecutorService and ScheduledExecutorService classes, which provide additional methods for managing threads, such as submit, invokeAll, and invokeAny.

```java
Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
executor.execute(new MyThread());
```

## Parallel vs Concurrent Programming
In parallel programming, multiple threads are created to work on different parts of a problem simultaneously, but the threads do not communicate with each other and the order of execution is not important. In concurrent programming, multiple threads are created to work on different parts of a problem simultaneously and the threads may communicate with each other and the order of execution is important.

For example, in a parallel program, you might use one thread to compute the sum of the elements in an array and another thread to compute the product of the elements in an array. These two threads will be running simultaneously and the result of one thread does not depend on the result of the other.

```java
class SumThread extends Thread {
    int[] array;
    int sum;
    public SumThread(int[] array) {
        this.array = array;
    }
    public void run() {
        for (int i : array) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
}

class ProductThread extends Thread {
    int[] array;
    int product;
    public ProductThread(int[] array) {
        this.array = array;
    }
    public void run() {
        product = 1;
        for (int i : array) {
            product *= i;
        }
    }
}

int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
SumThread sumThread = new SumThread(array);
ProductThread productThread = new ProductThread(array);
sumThread.start();
productThread.start();
```
Concurrently, if you are building a networked application and you use one thread to receive data from the network, and another thread to process the data, the order of execution is important and the threads will communicate with each other.
