# Library
Java has a vast standard library that provides a wide range of functionality, including input/output, data structures, and common algorithms. Exploring the standard library and becoming familiar with the classes and methods it provides can greatly enhance your ability to write efficient and effective Java code.

## Input/output
Java provides a number of classes for input/output, including the Scanner class, which is used to read input from the keyboard, and the PrintWriter class, which is used to write output to a file. The following example demonstrates how to use these classes to read input from the keyboard and write output to a file:

```java
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter("output.txt");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        writer.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        writer.close();
    }
}
```

## Data structures
Java provides several commonly used data structures in the java.util package, including ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, Stack, and Queue. These classes provide a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in an efficient and organized manner.

```java
import java.util.*;

// using an ArrayList
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
numbers.add(5);
numbers.add(10);
numbers.add(15);
int x = numbers.get(0);

// using a HashMap
Map<String, Integer> ages = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
ages.put("John", 30);
ages.put("Jane", 25);
int age = ages.get("John");

// using a Stack
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
stack.push(5);
stack.push(10);
int y = stack.pop();
```

## Algorithms
Java provides a number of classes that implement common algorithms, such as sorting and searching. The Collections class provides a number of static methods that can be used to sort and search lists, such as the sort and binarySearch methods.

```java
import java.util.*;

// sorting an array
int[] array = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
Arrays.sort(array);

// sorting a list
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(5, 10, 15, 20, 25);
Collections.sort(list);

// searching an array
int index = Arrays.binarySearch(array, 15);

// shuffling a list
Collections.shuffle(list);
```
