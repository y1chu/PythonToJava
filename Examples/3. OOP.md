# OOP

Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it uses the concepts of classes and objects to organize and manipulate data. These concepts do not exist in Python, so understanding them is essential to writing Java code.

## Classes and objects
In Java, a class is a blueprint for an object. It defines the data and behavior of the object. For example, a class called "Dog" might have data such as the dog's name and breed, and behavior such as the ability to bark or fetch. An object is an instance of a class. So, if you create two "Dog" objects, each object will have its own name and breed, but they will both have the ability to bark and fetch.

```java
class Dog {
    String name;
    String breed;
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof woof!");
    }
    void fetch() {
        System.out.println("Fetching...");
    }
}

Dog fido = new Dog();
fido.name = "Pochita";
fido.breed = "Devil Doggo";
fido.bark(); // prints "Woof woof!"
fido.fetch(); // prints "Fetching..."

Dog spot = new Dog();
spot.name = "Denji";
spot.breed = "Makima's Dog";
spot.bark(); // prints "Woof woof!"
spot.fetch(); // prints "Fetching..."
```

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of keeping the internal state of an object hidden from the outside world. In Java, encapsulation is achieved through the use of private fields and public methods. For example, if the name and breed fields of the Dog class were marked as private, they could only be accessed through public methods. This prevents outside code from directly modifying the internal state of the object.

```java
class Dog {
    private String name;
    private String breed;
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public String getBreed() {
        return breed;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void setBreed(String breed) {
        this.breed = breed;
    }
}
```

## Inheritance
Inheritance is the practice of creating a new class that inherits the properties and methods of an existing class. In Java, a class can inherit from another class using the extends keyword. For example, a class called "Labrador" could inherit from the "Dog" class, and it would have all the properties and methods of the "Dog" class, as well as any additional properties and methods that are specific to labradors.

```java
class Labrador extends Dog {
    int age;
    void swim() {
        System.out.println("Swimming...");
    }
}
```
These concepts: class, object, encapsulation, and inheritance, are the foundation of OOP in Java. Understanding them will be essential to writing Java code and creating large, complex programs.
